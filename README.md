## Introduction
This project was created to practice and apply the basic HTML skills by building a basic recipe website. This website will help me with proper usage of elements and tags discussed (texts, list, links and images). The website includes a main index page with links to individual recipe pages. 

## Objectives
By working on this project, I aim to:
- Show my ability to create well-structured HTML documents.
- Practice linking multiple HTML pages together.
- Use elements like lists, headings, paragraphs, and images to organize content effectively.
- Strengthen my understanding of semantic HTML elements.

## Project Structure
Here's how the project is organized:
1. **Index Page**: The main page that acts as the entry point and links to all the recipe pages.
2. **Recipe Pages**: Individual pages for each recipe, containing details like ingredients and cooking instructions.

## Self-Reflection
Once I finish this project, I'll take some time to reflect on what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I solved them. Writing down my thoughts will help me solidify my understanding and prepare for future projects.

## Next Steps
After completing the HTML portion, my next goal is to revisit this project and style it using CSS to make it more visually appealing.
