# odin-recipes

## Introduction

This project was created to practice and apply the basic HTML skills by building a basic recipe website. This website will help me with proper usage of elements and tags discussed (texts, list, links and images). The website includes a main index page with links to individual recipe pages.

## Objectives

By working on this project, I aim to:

- Show my ability to create a basic, well-structured HTML documents.
- Practice linking multiple HTML pages together.
- Use elements like lists, headings, paragraphs, and images to organize content effectively.
- Strengthen my understanding of semantic HTML elements.

## Project Structure

Here's how the project is organized:

1. **Index Page**: The main page that acts as the entry point and links to all the recipe pages.
2. **Recipe Pages**: Individual pages for each recipe, containing details like ingredients and cooking instructions.

## Self-Reflection

This project helped me review basic HTML tags and elements that I have gone over in TOP HTML Lessons.
It also helped me become more comfortable with using the CLI, git commands and gitHub.

## Next Steps

After completing the HTML portion, my next goal is to possibly tinker with this project by applying CSS and such to it. I look forward to revisiting this porject in the future and reflect on the progress Iâ€™ve hopefully made.
