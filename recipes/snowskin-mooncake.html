    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>100g glutinous rice flour</li>
      <li>50g icing sugar</li>
      <li>35g vegetable oil</li>
      <li>100ml milk</li>
      <li>1 egg yolk</li>
      <li>20g custard powder</li>
      <li>60g sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>Food coloring (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the custard filling by mixing custard powder, condensed milk,
        egg yolk, and milk in a bowl. Cook over low heat until thickened, then
        chill in the fridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, mix glutinous rice flour, icing sugar, vegetable
        oil, and milk to form the snowskin dough. Add food coloring if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Steam the snowskin dough for 20 minutes, stirring halfway through, and
        let it cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the cooled dough until smooth and pliable. Divide it into equal
        portions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the custard filling into equal portions and roll into balls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flatten each portion of dough and wrap it around a ball of custard
        filling. Roll gently to form a smooth ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the ball into a mooncake mold to shape it, then release it
        carefully.
      </li>
      <li>Chill the mooncakes in the fridge for 1-2 hours before serving.</li>
