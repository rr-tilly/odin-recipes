      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking
        soda, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, combine milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla
        extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until
        just combined. Avoid overmixing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease
        with butter or oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until
        bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2 minutes.

        Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until golden
        brown.
